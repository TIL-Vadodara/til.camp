Using this extensive board you can quickly and easily create any kind of electronic product that you can imagine! Everything from simple automation devices, to IoT projects!\nIn this TIL workshop, we will walk you through the process of building a secret knock detector. In this project, a secret knock will show a green light. If there’s any other knock pattern, it will be a red light.\nWorking with Arduino requires some basic coding knowledge. But you can still attend the workshop to know more about the world of DIY electronic prototyping.",presenter:"Nayaabkhan Khan",date:"2018-06-03",startTime:"11:00",endTime:"13:00",venue:{name:"Soul Brew, Vasna Road",address:"Siddharth Upscale, Vasna Road",googleMapLink:"https://goo.gl/maps/DWT4YKmvSYH2"}}},{node:{title:"Book Review of Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari",description:"On 1st of July we are kickstarting our TIL Book Club where we will discuss books and engage in readings (including articles and plays). The session will be moderated by Sneh Sonaiya (medical student).\nIn this edition, we are talking about Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari. On the face of it, it's a history book. But once you start reading, you realize it's so much more than that. It's one of the most thought provoking you'll ever read. It's about the past, present and the future of humanity. It scales from the cognitive revolution, the capitalist economy to the biohacking.\nAnd because it's a non-fiction book, you don't need to read it or complete it to join the session. Even if you've never read the book, the discussion will only add to your reading experience.",presenter:"Sneh Sonaiya",date:"2018-07-01",startTime:"11:00",endTime:"13:00",venue:{name:"Soul Brew, Vasna Road",address:"Siddharth Upscale, Vasna Road",googleMapLink:"https://goo.gl/maps/DWT4YKmvSYH2"}}},{node:{title:"Untitled Calligraphy Talk",description:null,presenter:"Avani Desai",date:"2018-07-15",startTime:"11:00",endTime:"13:00",venue:{name:"Saladific, Race Course",address:"The Emerald, Chakli Circle",googleMapLink:"https://goo.gl/maps/hHcVGLHJdpH2"}}},{node:{title:"Untitled Calligraphy Workshop",description:null,presenter:"Avani Desai",date:"2018-07-22",startTime:"11:00",endTime:"13:00",venue:{name:"Saladific, Race Course",address:"The Emerald, Chakli Circle",googleMapLink:"https://goo.gl/maps/hHcVGLHJdpH2"}}}]}},pathContext:{}}}});
