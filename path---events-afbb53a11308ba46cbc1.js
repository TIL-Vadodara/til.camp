The session will be moderated by Sneh Sonaiya (medical student).\nIn this edition, we are talking about Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari. On the face of it, it's a history book. But once you start reading, you realize it's so much more than that. It's one of the most thought provoking you'll ever read. It's about the past, present and the future of humanity. It scales from the cognitive revolution, the capitalist economy to the biohacking.\nAnd because it's a non-fiction book, you don't need to read it or complete it to join the session. Even if you've never read the book, the discussion will only add to your reading experience.",presenter:"Sneh Sonaiya",date:"2018-07-01",startTime:"11:00",endTime:"13:00",bannerUrl:"https://www.dropbox.com/s/hjony8l1hgqubgi/Banner%20%28Cover%29.png?raw=1",venue:{name:"Soul Brew, Vasna Road",address:"Siddharth Upscale, Vasna Road",googleMapLink:"https://goo.gl/maps/DWT4YKmvSYH2"}}},{node:{title:"The Past, Present and Future of Typography",description:null,presenter:"Avani Desai",date:"2018-07-15",startTime:"11:00",endTime:"13:00",bannerUrl:"https://www.dropbox.com/s/wrmiung02cv65hu/Banner%20%28Cover%29.png?raw=1",venue:{name:"Saladific, Race Course",address:"The Emerald, Chakli Circle",googleMapLink:"https://goo.gl/maps/hHcVGLHJdpH2"}}},{node:{title:"Learn Basics of Calligraphy in 2 Hours",description:null,presenter:"Avani Desai",date:"2018-07-22",startTime:"11:00",endTime:"13:00",bannerUrl:"https://www.dropbox.com/s/jhwtuja87k9vi0x/Banner%20%28Cover%29.png?raw=1",venue:{name:"Saladific, Race Course",address:"The Emerald, Chakli Circle",googleMapLink:"https://goo.gl/maps/hHcVGLHJdpH2"}}},{node:{title:"TIL#FooBaroda Tech Meetup",description:null,presenter:"Nayaabkhan Khan",date:"2018-08-12",startTime:"11:00",endTime:"13:00",bannerUrl:"https://www.dropbox.com/s/qod69m4ajynbgwa/Banner%20%28Cover%29.png?raw=1",venue:{name:"Basecamp",address:"A-146 Paris Nagar Society, Opp. Neel Kanth Society, Lions Hall Road, Diwalipura",googleMapLink:"https://goo.gl/maps/prZuFwZWHhx"}}},{node:{title:"TIL#Gaming Casual Meetup",description:null,presenter:"Parth Vyas Jaykumar",date:"2018-08-12",startTime:"14:00",endTime:"17:00",bannerUrl:"https://www.dropbox.com/s/uedoloyobhjkbjm/Banner%20%28Cover%29.png?raw=1",venue:{name:"Basecamp",address:"A-146 Paris Nagar Society, Opp. Neel Kanth Society, Lions Hall Road, Diwalipura",googleMapLink:"https://goo.gl/maps/prZuFwZWHhx"}}}]}},pathContext:{}}}});
